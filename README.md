# Machine learning

My implementation of machine learning stuff

First of all should mention the [research](https://github.com/zelzhan/Machine-learning/blob/master/research/Comparative%20study%20of%20the%20classification%20models%20for%20prediction%20of%20the%20bank%20telemarketing%20efficiency.pdf) paper and [accompanying code](https://github.com/zelzhan/Machine-learning/tree/master/research) that I have done

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

See requirements.txt

```
conda 4.5.4
python 3.6.4
etc
```

### Installing

Install anaconda 4 from the official site.

Then make aliasses for default versions of python and pip in the /.bashsrc:

```
alias python = python3
alias pip = pip3
```

Create and activate enviroment via anaconda and install all packages required in the requirements.txt

```
conda create yourenvname
source activate yourenvname
```
